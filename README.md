# Three FPS Exercise 🎯🕹️

Welcome to **Three FPS Exercise**, where we attempt to create a FPS-style game using **Three.js** and **WebGLRenderer**. It’s an exercise for mastering Three.js and, let’s be honest, a product of sheer boredom. 🦊

## Features 🚀

- **FPS Gameplay**: Move around with WASD and explore the minimalistic world.
- **Weapon System**: Pretend to shoot things (pew pew sounds not included yet).
- **Lighting Effects**: Because every FPS needs dramatic lighting.  
- **Boredom Reliever**: Works 60% of the time, every time.

   ```bash

   ```

## Why This Exists? 🤔

- **Exercise**: A hands-on way to master Three.js and WebGL rendering.  
- **Fun**: Why not make a FPS while learning?  
- **Boredom**: Yes, boredom. 🦊

## What’s Next? 🔮

- Adding actual enemies to fight (currently it’s just you and the void).  
- Weapon upgrades (for no reason at all).  
- Maybe some sound effects (so you feel cooler while shooting).  

Until then, explore the world, practice your aim, and stay curious! 🌌
